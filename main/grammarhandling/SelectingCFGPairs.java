/**
 * This class provides functionality for, given a single .txt file with many student-given grammars, selecting
 * grammars from those and writing these to separate .txt files with the correct-answer grammar.
 *
 * <p>This class writes files with naming convention: question/result/number.txt, where:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>question is the name(number) of the Iltis question</li>
 *     <li>result is the Iltis-provided result (EQUIVALENT, NOT_EQUIVALENT, UNKNOWN)</li>
 *     <li>number is unique for CFG's where question and result are the same</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
